# Sentiment Analysis of Mailing Lists
Project Overview
This repository contains the code and report for my dissertation, which focuses on sentiment analysis of mailing lists using various natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models. The project evaluates the effectiveness of three sentiment analysis techniques: VADER, BERT, and DistilBERT, and provides insights into the emotional tone of mailing list communications.

Experiments
Three experiments were conducted using the following models:

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner):

A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool.
Suitable for short texts like social media posts and emails.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):

A transformer-based model pre-trained on a large corpus of data.
Provides more nuanced understanding by considering the context in both directions.

DistilBERT:

A smaller, faster version of BERT.
Retains a high level of accuracy while being more efficient in terms of processing time.

Repository Structure
Notebooks Folder: Contains the Jupyter notebooks used for each experiment with VADER, BERT, and DistilBERT models.
Report: The final report detailing the methods, results, and conclusions of this project.
